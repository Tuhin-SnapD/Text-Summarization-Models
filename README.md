# Text-Summarization-Models

This repository contains Python implementations of various text summarization models. Text summarization is the process of generating a shorter version of a longer text while preserving its most important information. It has many practical applications, such as summarizing news articles or academic papers, and can be used to save time and improve comprehension.

## Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the models, we have used the ROUGE metric (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation), which is commonly used for evaluating the quality of automatic summarization.

## Models

The repository contains several different 18 text summarization models.
Apart from this 12 more Pegasus models were implemented to compute the scores, and 1 Novel Graph Method was also implemented
