        "\n",
        "**Cluster-based algorithms** for text summarization are a class of unsupervised algorithms that group similar sentences into clusters and then extract summary sentences from these clusters. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of cluster-based algorithms for text summarization:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Pros:\n",
        "*\tFlexibility: Cluster-based algorithms are very flexible, as they can handle different types of texts, such as news articles, academic papers, and social media posts, among others.\n",
        "*\tLanguage independence: These algorithms are language-independent, which means they can summarize texts in any language.\n",
        "*\tEfficient: Cluster-based algorithms are relatively fast and can summarize large amounts of text quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Cons:\n",
        "*\tClustering errors: The quality of the summary depends heavily on the quality of the clustering, and the clustering may not always be accurate, leading to poor summaries.\n",
        "*\tLack of coherence: Cluster-based algorithms may extract sentences from different clusters, leading to a lack of coherence in the summary.\n",
        "*\tLimited coverage: Cluster-based algorithms tend to summarize the most important sentences, but may miss some important details that are not explicitly mentioned in the text.\n",
        "*\tDifficulty in determining optimal number of clusters: One of the key challenges in cluster-based summarization is determining the optimal number of clusters, which can be difficult.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, cluster-based algorithms are a useful approach for summarizing text, but they do have limitations that need to be considered when using them.\n",
        "\n",
        "These are the scores we achieved:\n",
        "\n",
        "      ROUGE Score:\n",
        "      Precision: 0.980\n",
        "      Recall: 0.331\n",
        "      F1-Score: 0.495\n",
        "\n",
        "      BLEU Score: 0.896\n",
        "\n",
        "## References\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some research papers on cluster-based text summarization:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. \"Cluster-Based Multi-Document Summarization Using Centroid-Based Clustering\" by S. Aravindan and S. Natarajan. This paper proposes a centroid-based clustering approach for multi-document summarization.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. \"Cluster-Based Summarization of Web Documents\" by M. Shishibori, Y. Kawai, and M. Ishikawa. This paper presents a cluster-based approach for summarizing web documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. \"Summarizing Text Documents by Sentence Extraction Using Latent Semantic Analysis\" by J. Steinberger and K. Jezek. This paper proposes a cluster-based approach using Latent Semantic Analysis for sentence extraction in text summarization.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. \"Multi-document Summarization Using Clustering and Sentence Extraction\" by C. Wang, Y. Liu, and J. Zhu. This paper proposes a clustering and sentence extraction approach for multi-document summarization.\n",

Since then, over 13 million doses have been administered across the country. However, the pace of the vaccination drive has been slower than expected, with concerns raised over vaccine hesitancy and logistical challenges.The expansion of the vaccination drive to include the elderly and those with co-morbidities is a major step towards achieving herd immunity and controlling the spread of the virus in India. The Health Ministry has also urged eligible individuals to come forward and get vaccinated at the earliest.India has reported over 11 million cases of COVID-19, making it the second-worst affected country in the world after the United States.
