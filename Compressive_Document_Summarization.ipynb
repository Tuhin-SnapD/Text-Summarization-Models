        "# CDS\n",
        "**CDS (Compressive Document Summarization)** is a deep learning-based approach for text summarization that uses a combination of extractive and abstractive techniques. Here are some pros and cons of text summarization of news articles using CDS:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Pros:\n",
        "\n",
        "* High compression: CDS can generate highly compressed summaries that retain the most important information from the input text, making it useful for summarizing long documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Combines extractive and abstractive techniques: CDS combines the benefits of extractive and abstractive summarization techniques, resulting in summaries that are both informative and concise.\n",
        "\n",
        "* High accuracy: CDS has achieved state-of-the-art performance on many benchmark datasets for text summarization, indicating that it can generate high-quality summaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Customizable: CDS can be fine-tuned on specific domains or use cases, allowing users to generate summaries tailored to their needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Cons:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Resource-intensive: Training and using CDS for text summarization requires significant computational resources, including high-end GPUs, large amounts of memory, and high-speed storage.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Large model size: CDS is a large model that requires a lot of disk space to store, making it challenging to deploy on devices with limited storage capacity.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Dependence on training data: CDS's performance is highly dependent on the quality and relevance of the training data used to train the model. If the training data is biased or limited, the quality of the summaries may be compromised.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Expertise required: Fine-tuning CDS for specific use cases or domains requires expertise in natural language processing and machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, CDS is a powerful tool for text summarization that can generate highly compressed and informative summaries. However, it requires significant computational resources and expertise to use effectively, making it best suited for large-scale projects or applications where high accuracy is critical.\n",
        "\n",
        "These are the scores we achieved:\n",
        "\n",
        "    ROUGE Score:\n",
        "    Precision: \n",

The move is expected to cover an additional 270 million people, making it one of the largest vaccination drives in the world.The decision was taken after a meeting of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC), which recommended the expansion of the vaccination program. The NEGVAC also suggested that private hospitals may be allowed to administer the vaccine, although the details of this are yet to be finalized.India began its vaccination drive in mid-January, starting with healthcare and frontline workers. Since then, over 13 million doses have been administered across the country. However, the pace of the vaccination drive has been slower than expected, with concerns raised over vaccine hesitancy and logistical challenges.The expansion of the vaccination drive to include the elderly and those with co-morbidities is a major step towards achieving herd immunity and controlling the spread of the virus in India. The Health Ministry has also urged eligible individuals to come forward and get vaccinated at the earliest.India has reported over 11 million cases of COVID-19, making it the second-worst affected country in the world after the United States. The country's daily case count has been declining in recent weeks, but experts have warned that the pandemic is far from over and that precautions need to be maintained.\n",
